const basicParagraph = `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Practice typing every day to improve your speed and accuracy. Start slow, then gradually increase your pace. Focus on hitting the right keys without looking at your keyboard. Good posture and proper hand placement will make typing more comfortable and efficient. Remember to keep your wrists relaxed and your shoulders loose while you type. Take short breaks to avoid fatigue and maintain focus throughout your practice sessions. `;

const intermediateParagraph = `Typing is an essential skill in today's digital world. Whether you're writing emails, coding, or creating documents, efficient typing saves time. Proper technique includes keeping your fingers on the home row (ASDF-JKL;) and using all fingers. Regular practice will help you develop muscle memory and reduce errors. Try to maintain a consistent rhythm as you type. `;

const advancedParagraph = `According to research, the average typing speed is about 40 words per minute (WPM), while professional typists often exceed 75 WPM. To improve, practice daily for 15-30 minutes using proper finger placement. The home row keys are fundamental: left hand (A-S-D-F) and right hand (J-K-L-;). Remember to use the shift key for capital letters and practice special characters like @, #, and &. Accuracy is more important than speed when starting - speed will naturally follow as your muscle memory develops. `;

const funParagraph = `Imagine you're writing the next great novel or composing an important business proposal. Fluent typing lets your ideas flow seamlessly from mind to screen. Did you know the world record typing speed is 216 WPM? While you may not reach that, consistent practice can double your current speed. Enjoy the rhythmic sound of keys clicking as you progress from hunt-and-peck to touch typing mastery! `;
